        Calorie, Water, and Workout tracking the smart way
        <p> The basic premise is calorie counting sucks. Its hard and at most it gives us a ~general~ ballpark idea into what we're really consuming.
            If we break apart what we really want to track it all comes down to general energy in, water consumed (because its good for you!), and general energy out.
            The easier it is for us to ballpark these estimates, the easier it is for us to keep track of a general estimate of our calories.
            Easy is better.
            At least in my opinion.
